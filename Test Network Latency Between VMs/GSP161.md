## 🌐 **Quick Start Guide:**

**Launch Cloud Shell:**
Start your Google CloudShell session by [clicking here](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=&pli=1&cloudshell=true).

```bash
export ZONE_1=

export ZONE_2=

export ZONE_3=

```
- This command sets the zone for your cloud resources. Replace 'ZONE' with the zone you want to use, based on the lab instructions.



```bash
curl -LO raw.githubusercontent.com/quiccklabs/Labs_solutions/master/Test%20Network%20Latency%20Between%20VMs/quicklabgsp161.sh
```
- This command downloads the setup script from GitHub. The script will help configure the environment and perform necessary setup steps.


```bash
sudo chmod +x quicklabgsp161.sh
```
- This command gives execution permission to the script so that it can run.

```bash
./quicklabgsp161.sh
```
- This runs the script to set up your environment for the lab. It will provision resources and configure them as needed.
