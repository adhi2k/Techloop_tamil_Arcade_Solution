## 🌐 **Quick Start Guide:**

**Launch Cloud Shell:**
Start your Google CloudShell session by [clicking here](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=&pli=1&cloudshell=true).



```bash
curl -LO raw.githubusercontent.com/quiccklabs/Labs_solutions/refs/heads/master/Google%20Kubernetes%20Engine%3A%20Qwik%20Start%20ACE/quicklab.sh
sudo chmod +x quicklab.sh
./quicklab.sh
```
- This runs the script to set up your environment for the lab. It will provision resources and configure them as needed.

**Once you get a score `75/100` Then only run below command**
